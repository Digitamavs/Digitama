**Turning Meme Belief into Settleable Futures**

Autom9 is an on-chain prediction protocol that transforms meme belief, sentiment, and narrative consensus into tradable, multi-outcome futures.  
Rather than reducing the future to binary answers, Autom9 allows markets to price belief across multiple fate paths.

## 🧠 What Is Autom9?

Markets do not move on truth alone — they move on belief.  
Autom9 captures collective conviction and expresses it as on-chain price signals.

Each market represents a meme, narrative, or idea about the future.  
Participants express belief by allocating capital across multiple possible outcomes, allowing consensus to emerge organically.

## 📜 Philosophy

Autom9 is not just a prediction market.  
It is an experiment in how belief, memes, and narratives shape reality when given a financial form.

Belief becomes price.  
Price becomes signal.  
Signal becomes consensus.
