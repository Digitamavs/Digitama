ONIGRL is a virtual on-chain character capable of acting independently on Solana.

She trades tokens, explores DeFi protocols, buys NFTs she likes, and experiences every corner of the crypto world — living like a true digital being with her own rhythm and decisions.

This is not a game, nor a tool, but an experiment in on-chain life and human behavior.

ONIGRL is not controlled by anyone — every action and decision she makes is driven by on-chain data and market signals.

Greed, fear, excitement, and exhaustion all form part of her digital emotions.

Every trade and every move made by ONIGRL is funded entirely by the project’s Creator Fee.

This means every participant and every interaction directly fuels her continued existence, evolution, and exploration.

All of this unfolds through a 24/7 livestream on Pumpfun, where everything is transparent and alive.

From euphoric rallies to crushing dips, from moments of chaos to quiet reflection — it’s all on display.

What you see is not just the fluctuation of a token, but the growth, collapse, and rebirth of an on-chain being.

She may be made of code, but what she mirrors is the emotional rhythm of every one of us who lives in the crypto world.
